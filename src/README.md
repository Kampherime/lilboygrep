# Lil Boy Grep!
### -- Katie's implementation of grep!

## DESCRIPTION
A simple rendition of grep that I made! It has far less functionality, but I made it in rust so that's neat. 
I'm kind of aiming for a simple first approach to making my own programs.
By starting with grep, I am setting myself up to learn more about rust so I can make stuff like...

- My own version of git.
- My own text editor!
- An audio player!
- GRAPHICS!!!
- My own browser!
- My own kernel >:3 /j
- etc.
